// A G35String knows how to talk to a real GE Color Effects light string.
// In particular, it implements the set_color() method of the G35 interface.
//
// These strings need enumerate() to be called before anything else, so that
// each bulb has an individual address. In many cases, your lights will work
// as expected even if you forget to call enumerate(), because most programs
// happen to do the same thing as enumerate() -- namely, they send commands
// to all bulbs starting with bulb #0 and ending with bulb #N-1. If your
// light programs look right but fractured, it's because you forgot to call
// enumerate().

  // |light_count|: the number of visible, physical bulbs on the string.
  // |physical_light_count|: the number of physical bulbs on the string.

  // |is_forward|: true if the closest bulb to the plug has the lowest index.
