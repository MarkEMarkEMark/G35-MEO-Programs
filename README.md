G35-MEO-Programs
================

New programs for sowbug's G35 Ardunino 

Uses https://github.com/sowbug/G35Arduino as a framework.

Has new MEOPrograms.cpp / .h with more imaginative programs from other light projects and my own original work. The other light project programs have been modified with more options thought up by me.

- MEORainbow1 (based on Adafruit's LED light strip sample code: https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806)
- MEORainbow2 (based on Adafruit's LED light strip sample code: https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806)
- MEORandomStrobe (my own)
- MEOSimplexNoise (based on happyinmotion's noise experiments http://happyinmotion.livejournal.com/278357.html)
- MEOSineWave (based on Adafruit's LED light strip sample code: https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806)


I've a lot of parameters in the programs - however, not being a C++ programmer, I've no idea how to change these from the calling select case statements in MEOProgram.cpp. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd be grateful. I'd like to be able to change these parameters from push buttons that I've set up. I'm not posting the code for that and I wan't to keep this repository simple for the time being.
